# Fresnel reflectivity from an air-water interface
# Almost identical to test2, except that the slabs are
# generated from slicing up an error function. Each
# microslab is given a zero roughness.
# The purpose of this test is to check how different
# implementations treat roughnesses. Both test2 and
# test3 represent a Gaussian roughness of an interface
# and should give identical reflectivities.
# The error function is calculated as:
#
# from scipy.special import erf
# x = np.linspace(-25, 25., 2001)
# y = 6.36 * (0.5 * (erf(x / np.sqrt(2.) / 3.) + 1))
#
# The factor of sqrt(2) is to normalise it to the CDF
# of the unit normal distribution.
